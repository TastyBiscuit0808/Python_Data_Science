    "Statistical hypothesis tests are based on a statement called the null hypothesis that assumes nothing interesting is going on between whatever variables you are testing. The exact form of the null hypothesis varies from one type test to another: if you are testing whether groups differ, the null hypothesis states that the groups are the same. For instance, if you wanted to test whether the average age of voters in your home state differs from the national average, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the average ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a hypothesis test is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: that something interesting is going on. The exact form of the alternative hypothesis will depend on the specific test you are carrying out. Continuing with the example above, the alternative hypothesis would be that the average age of voters in your state does in fact differ from the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a significance level (often denoted by the Greek letter α.). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you reject the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as extreme as the one you observe due to chance is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. This probability of seeing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed is known as the p-value.\n",
